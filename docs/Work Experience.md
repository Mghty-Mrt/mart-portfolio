## 🔧 Infrastructure & Load Balancing

- Deployed a resilient Kong API Gateway cluster with three load-balanced nodes for high availability and seamless traffic routing.

- Built an NGINX load balancer in Docker Compose with real-time health checks and auto-rerouting to healthy Kong nodes.

---

## 📊 Observability & Logging

- Centralized Kong logs via Promtail with tagged metadata and failover transparency in Grafana.

- Verified cluster failover through controlled node outages and recovery testing to meet uptime goals.

---

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

- Implemented a full observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Promtail) with dashboards for API performance and error tracking.

---

## 🖥️ Virtualization & Resource Optimization

- Managed VMware vSphere ESXi stack for consolidating services and optimizing infrastructure resources.

- Confidently administered VMware ESXi environments, enabling the reduction of physical server needs by implementing a scalable and virtualized infrastructure.

- Utilized virtualization to create, clone, and migrate servers efficiently, optimizing resource utilization and enhancing flexibility in server management.

---

## 🛠️ Linux System Oversight

- Managed Ubuntu/Debian Servers: Ensured secure, multi-tenant environments by administering Ubuntu/Debian servers, implementing best practices for system security and performance optimization.

---

## 🐳 Standerdized Deployments with Docker Compose:

- Developed and utilized Docker Compose to create standardized deployment processes for efficient application management. 

- Implemented containerization strategies that simplified configuration modifications and ensured isolated networking for specific groups of containers.
 
- Organized deployment projects by creating structured folders containing Docker Compose files, which facilitated easy access to configurations and insights into the containerized application's environment, including configurations, databases, and directory structures.

---

## ⚙️ Optimized Server Provisioning with Ansible:

 - Created and maintained Ansible scripts for automating the provisioning and configuration of multiple servers simultaneously.

 - Ensured applications were deployed across servers with uniform configurations, enhancing consistency, reducing setup time, and minimizing configuration drift.

---

## 🔐 Reverse Proxy Design

- Configured NGINX as a reverse proxy to enhance security and efficiently manage incoming traffic. 

- Implemented access control measures ensuring that internal resources were accessible only via DNS, masking real IP addresses for added security.

- Built flexible reverse proxy layers with Nginx and Caddy for SSL termination and dynamic route management.

---

## 🗃️ Database Administration

- Administered MySQL and MSSQL databases for internal tools and monitoring systems.

---

## 🧩 Platform Integration & Service Management for internal use

- Integrated communication (FreePBX, 3CX)
- Storage (Samba, Nextcloud, Syncthing)
- Backup (Duplicati)
- Remote Access (Remotely)
