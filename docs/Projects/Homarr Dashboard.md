## Dashboard
- This is my internal dashboard for, where I centralized access to our monitoring tools, remote access platforms, and key infrastructure systems. I grouped services Server Monitoring for quick visibility, and added tools to manage branch systems securely.

- It helps me respond faster to issues, monitor uptime, and streamline troubleshooting across multiple environments. I built it to reduce friction, improve team handoff, and keep our infrastructure transparent and scalable.
