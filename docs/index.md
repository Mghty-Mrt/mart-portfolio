Iâ€™m a Junior System Administrator at Wilcon Depot Head Office, specializing in managing multi-branch deployments within Linux environments using automation tools. My core responsibilities include patching and maintaining ETP servers and POS systems, troubleshooting and reconfiguring system errors, and monitoring critical infrastructure through VMware vSphere ESXi.

With a solid foundation in system administration and a growing interest in DevOps, I continuously seek to improve infrastructure efficiency, streamline deployment processes, and enhance system reliability. Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging open-source technologies and automation to solve operational challenges and support scalable IT solutions.

Currently, I'm expanding my skills in scripting, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud platforms. I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver results.
