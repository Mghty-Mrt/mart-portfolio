Aspiring System Administrator/DevOps Engineer with a solid foundation in managing multi-branch Linux deployments. Currently based at Wilcon Depot Head Office, I specialize in enhancing infrastructure efficiency and reliability through meticulous patching and maintenance of ETP servers and POS systems, systematic troubleshooting, and reconfiguring system errors. My expertise extends to monitoring critical infrastructure using VMware vSphere ESXi.

I am passionate about leveraging open-source technologies and automation to address operational challenges and support scalable IT solutions. With a keen interest in DevOps, I am actively developing skills in scripting, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud platforms.

I excel in fast-paced environments and thrive on collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive impactful results. Through continuous learning and hands-on experience, I am dedicated to mastering the art of seamless and efficient deployment processes.
